#Introduction

##What is Scala

Scala is a programming language using mixture of object-oriented and functional programming approach, run on top of JVM.
Scala attempt to achieve expressiveness on solving problems without sacrificing type-safety and stability.

##Why Scala
Scala is suitable for building application that need complex data model and operations (web applications, 
background services, data processing pipeline, etc). Specifically, programmer can deliver simple program (due to its 
expressiveness) yet powerful and stable (due to its type-safety).

##When not to use Scala
Scala is not suitable for problem that does not need complex data modelling or application that has strict memory 
consumption due to the nature of JVM
